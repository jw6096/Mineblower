# Mineblower

Thanks for checking out my project! In this project I composed some music pieces and loops for a game called Mineblower.
It was a class project in which I am very proud of. I put in a ton of work and effort into this project and I would personally like
to say that it came out very nicely.



The game itself was not coded by me. I have no idea who coded it, but when this game was given to me as an assignment my task was to replace the main game sounds effects and music. You need a program called Processing in order to play the game with my music. My music files are WAV files, so you can just listen to them instead. I used Ableton Live to create the music compositions.



The following pieces of music are what I worked on:

In the JukeBox folder: Backgnd0, Backgnd1, Backgnd2, Backgnd3, Backgnd4 (Backgnd5 is a silent sound file for the game to run smoothly)

In the AmbientSub folder: Snd0, Snd1, Snd2, Snd3

In the ZapLayers folder: ZapLoop0, ZapLoop1, ZapLoop2, ZapLoop3, ZapLoop4

In the YellowSub folder: YelSub0, YelSub1, YelSub2, YelSub3 (YelSub4 is a silent sound file for the game to run smoothly)

In the TorpDialog folder: TorpLine0, TorpLine1, TorpLine2, TorpLine3, TorpLine4, TorpLine5, TorpLine6, TorpLine7 (some are silent because 
it made the game sound effects awful)

In the OmLayers folder: OmLayer0, OmLayer1, OmLayer2, OmLayer3

In the main Audio Folder: Bang, Bubbles, DepthChgCue, Disarm, DisarmSting, Dive, ExplodeSting, TorpFire, TorpLoad, TorpRun, Win, Zap (the rest of the audio in that main folder is silent because I did not like how it mixed with the rest of the game).




Thank you for checking out this music project! I had a ton of fun making it and I hope you have lots of fun playing it.
